### How to use

1. Create a [list](https://support.twitter.com/articles/76460-using-twitter-lists) on Twitter with the word 'Dodo' in its title
2. Go to [Dodo](http://dodo-twitter.herokuapp.com/) and authorize your Twitter account
3. Follow Twitter users and add them to your 'Dodo' list
4. Every month, this app will automatically unfollow them for you

### Running Locally

Make sure you have `node 0.11.x` installed, as [Koa](http://koajs.com/) requires generators.

#### Getting `node 0.11.x` and `mongoDB`

- You can install `node 0.10.33` (or the latest stable version of `node`) [here](http://nodejs.org/download/)
- Then install [`n`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/n), a nifty node management tool, with `npm install -g n` in your terminal
- Once `n` is installed, then run `n 0.11.14`
- Install `mongoDB` [here](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/)

#### Running the server

Afterwards, run the following commands:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:lambtron/node-koa-mongo-swig-seed.git
$ cd node-koa-mongo-swig-seed
$ mongod
$ make
```

You should see:

```
listening on port 3000
```

Then, point your browser to `localhost:3000`.

### Deploying to Heroku

Make sure you have a [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com) account and you have Heroku's [CLI](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/) installed. Afterwards, run the following commands.

```
$ heroku create
Creating polar-escarpment-5726... done, stack is cedar-14
https://polar-escarpment-5726.herokuapp.com/ | git@heroku.com:polar-escarpment-5726.git
Git remote heroku added
$ git push heroku master
```

Then, point your browser to `https://polar-escarpment-5726.herokuapp.com/`.
